2. Solution with promises using then() and catch() blocks

PROMISES have 3 states
1. Pending
2. Fullfilled
3. Rejected 

            PROMISE 
            Pending 
    Rejected        Fulfilled 


3. Solution with async-await keywords
-async used for function
-await used for all the asynchronous code within the async function block 
-await cannot be used without async. In other way, await keyword is allowed only within async functions.
-await is redundant to use in front of a function if the function is not returning a promise
