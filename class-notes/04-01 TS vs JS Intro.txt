*** undefined is the value of a variable that declared but not assigned with any value.
*** null is explicitly state absence of info-data
The typeof operator will return object for null 

*TypeScript has exactly same types and couple more types
** any type does not exist in JavaScript, it is unique to TypeScript 
** Union types and literal types are also belong to TypeScript only. 

use 'let' when you know you'll be reassigning often (changing varible's value)
use 'const' when you know you wont need to reassign as 'const' makes the variable final (cannot be changed once in)

block scope -- can declare 'let' and 'const' global varibles to use in and out of of code block
