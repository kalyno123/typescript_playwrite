JAVA ARRAYS: Cannot be resized, you cannot add or remove elements
Once you declare the Java Array, you cannot change the size 


JS and TS: Array is mutable, meaning you can add, remove elements and change the size.


How do you make sure a variable is an array in JS/TS?
- isArray() method


Adding elements - returns the new size
push() -> adds to the end 
unshift() -> adds to the start 

Removing elements - returns the removed elements
pop() -> removes the last element 
shift() -> removes the first element


Spread Operator (...)
-It is an ES6 feature
-Used to spread array elements as individual arguments to an method or to another array
    - The spread operator is a feature in JavaScript that allows us to expand elements of an 
    iterable (like an array or string) or object properties into places where multiple elements or properties are expected.
