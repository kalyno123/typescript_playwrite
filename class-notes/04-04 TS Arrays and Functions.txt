IIFE: A function invoking itself just once whenever program reaches to it. 
It cannot be executed explicitly as it does not have a name to invoke.


function funcA(callbackFunction: (): void): void {
    // block of code
}

function funcB (): void {
    // block of code
}

funcA(funcB);

funcA is the higher order function 
funcB is the callback function


forEach() -> use it when you do not return anything but execute a function for each element in the array
map() -> use it if you will modify and return each array element with a function
filter ->  use it when you will check all the array elements which passes a test and store them in a new array



map = same size
filter = usually a smaller 
reduce = single value
